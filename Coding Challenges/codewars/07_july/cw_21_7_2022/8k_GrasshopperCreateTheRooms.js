// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
var rooms = {
  "room1": {"name": "first room",
           "description": "something",
           "completed": true},
  
  "room2": {"name": "first room",
           "description": "something",
           "completed": true},
  
  "room3": {"name": "first room",
           "description": "something",
           "completed": true}
}
